Code Book
==========
This code book will describe the data used in this project and the processing required to create the resulting tidy data set. More information about the files is available in `README.txt`.

Subjects:
30 volunteers performed 6 different activities while wearing a Samsung Galaxy S Smartphone. This data was collected from the accelerometers from the phone.

1. Read data and Merge
* subject_test : subject IDs for test. Contains a vector of 2947 integers, denoting the ID of the volunteer related to each of the observations in `X_test.txt`.
* subject_train  : subject IDs for train. Contains a vector of 7352 integers, denoting the ID of the subject related to each of the observations in `X_train.txt`.
* X_test : values of variables in test. 2947 observations of the 561 features, for 9 of the 30 volunteers.
* X_train : values of variables in train. 7352 observations of the 561 features, for 21 of the 30 volunteers.
* y_test : activity ID in test. 2947 integers, denoting the ID of the activity related to each of the observations in `X_test.txt`.
* y_train : activity ID in train. 7352 integers, denoting the ID of the activity related to each of the observations in `X_train.txt`.
* activity_labels : Description of activity IDs in y_test and y_train. Total of 6 activities
* features : description(label) of each variables in X_test and X_train. Total of 561 features.

2. Extract only mean() and std()
All feature columns were removed that did not contain the exact string "mean()" or "std()". 

3. Changing Column label of dataSet
Create a vector of "clean" feature names by getting rid of "()" at the end. Then, will apply that to the dataSet to rename column labels.

4. Adding Subject and Activity to the dataSet
Combine test data and train data of subject and activity, then give descriptive lables.

5. Rename ID to activity name
Group the activity column of dataSet as "act_group", then rename each levels with 2nd column of activity_levels. Finally apply the renamed "act_group" to dataSet's activity column.


## 6. Output tidy data
In this part, dataSet is melted to create tidy data, which is outputed as "tidy_data.txt"
